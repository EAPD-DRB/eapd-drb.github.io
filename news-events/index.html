    <h2>Workshop on SDG7 Implementation in Asia and the Pacific</h2>

    <strong>19-21 March 2019</strong>

    <img src="/images/news-events/bangkok.jpg">

    <p>The UNDP Bangkok Regional Hub jointly with KTH (Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden) organized an event on integrated modelling within a larger workshop on SDG7 implementation in Asia Pacific, hosted and organized by ESCAP and UN DESA. The workshop brought together about 90 participants from 17 countries in Asia and CIS, representatives from Africa and Latin America regions, and 20 global and regional organizations, including UN agencies. For the agenda and presentations, please click <a href="https://www.unescap.org/events/workshop-sdg7-implementation-asia-and-pacific">here</a>. Energy, agriculture and land use change contribute more than 90% of greenhouse gas emissions. Action on climate change needs to focus on these areas. At the same time, energy is fundamental for achieving (or not) many sustainable development goals. These natural resource and environmental systems are interdependent in the real world. Further, they also impact our economies and people.</p>
    
    <p>By modelling energy, water, land use and climate in an integrated framework, analysts have generated insights for integrated policy making. Such integrated models have also been linked with economy-wide models to estimate impacts on GDP, fiscal spending and household incomes. They help generate insights into precisely the kind of complex development challenges that are at the heart of integrated SDG actions and help governments with coherent and more realistic planning.</p>
    
    <p>The event featured three types of modelling tools developed and/or refined in recent years by a group of experts and academics, with KTH at the lead: (1) OnSSET, a geo-spatial tool being used by the World Bank for least-cost electrification planning; (2) OSeMOSYS, an open-source version of an established energy modelling tool used for assessment and planning of bulk energy investment, and (3) CLEWs, an integrated framework bringing together Climate, Land, Energy and Water models.</p>
    
    <p>UNDP BPPS and UNDESA have supported capacity development of analysts and policy makers to build and use such models in nine countries in Latin America and Africa so far. The workshop featured national, city-level and sub-regional applications of such integrated models. In Nicaragua, for example, the integrated model helped to assess how does the stated policy goal to increase agricultural and livestock production reconcile with the policy goal of increasing reforestation, how the demand on water from increased use of energy and satisfy growing demand from other sectors – such as growing crops can be addressed. By linking the integrated climate-land-energy-water model results with an economy-wide model, analysts also showed how are the planned investments in energy expected to impact green house gas emissions, GDP and household consumption.</p>
    
    <p>Other institutions also supported such integrated modelling exercises in cities, of which two were featured at the event: in a very big city (New York) and in a very small city (Oskarsham, Sweden). Other cases profiled included Bolivia (energy and integrated resource modelling assessing various energy scenarios as planned in Bolivia’s National Development Plan by 2030 and how they feed into Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) for reduction in green house gas emissions, a commitment made under COP21/ Paris Agreement; and a sub-regional assessment of the Indus River basin spanning Afghanistan, China, Pakistan, and India and providing over 90% of food supply in Pakistan. The event also set the foundation for the Asia-Pacific Energy & Integrated Resource Modelling Platform. </p>

    <h2>Supporting Policy Coherence in Ethiopia using the CLEWs framework</h2>

    <strong>17 January 2019</strong>

    <img src="/images/news-events/clewsethiopiajan2019.jpg">

    <p>African countries face important sustainable development challenges. Food security, energy for all, and facilitating water access remain some of the main concerns to ensure the wellbeing of the population. However, these all rely on natural resources that are highly sensitive to climate change and variability. Addressing these development issues will require quantitative modelling tools and an integrated approach to policymaking, ensuring that overlapping goals, interlinked challenges and potential tradeoffs are considered when planning for mid and long-term policies.</p>
      
      <p>To support Ethiopia in this endeavor, UNDESA, UNDP and the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) are implementing a project that will focus on two areas: 1) the development of an integrated climate, land, energy and water (CLEWs) assessment to identify sectoral interlinkages and trade-offs, and assess alternative scenarios to mitigate unwanted policy outcomes; and 2) support policy coherence and institutional strengthening to facilitate coordination among stakeholders in areas related to sustainable development.</p>
      
      <p>As part of the project, a scoping mission was organized (11-18 January) and a one-day national inception workshop took place in Addis Ababa (17 January). These activities introduced the project’s objectives, the CLEWs framework and the importance of designing coherent policies for sustainable development. The event had the participation of the Minister of Water, irrigation and Electricity, Mr. Seleshi Bekele, and approximately 70 participants from various ministries.</p>

    <h2>Scoping mission to Dakar completed</h2>

    <img src="/images/news-events/73448563b4c6bf65399d0258088fc4f7.jpg">

    <p>A scoping mission to Dakar, Senegal assessed prospects for UNDESA and UNDP to help develop capacities in integrated methodologies that support evidence-based sustainable development policies. The mission included meetings with the Office of the Prime Minister, the Ministry of Finance, Economy and Planning at various levels, the Ministry of Energy, the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, the Ministry of Agriculture, the National Agency of Civil Aviation and Meteorology, and the UNDP country office. </p>

    <p>The mission found strong interest from all ministries and specialized departments. There is pre-existing capacity in energy, systems dynamic, water management and climate modelling, which is a valuable input for delivering a country project. No significant capacity on multisectoral integrated modelling was found, however, which is where the proposed project could be of greatest value. The government of Senegal will discuss how to coordinate the project and potential contributions to implementation.</p>

    <h2>Modelling Sustainable Development in Bolivia</h2>

    <p>Since 2006, UNDESA and UNDP, have been supporting the Plurinational State of Bolivia to strengthen the analytical capacities of government officials to inform development policies by using modelling tools. Through several capacity development projects, economy-wide and energy systems models have been transferred and a set of policy scenarios have been developed to address key issues of interest to the government.  This collaboration has resulted in several contributions, including publications and policy notes prepared by government officials to disseminate the results and the findings of the modelling assessments.  An inter-ministerial modelling team of government officials has been established that is now capable to undertake policy analysis in response to requests from senior decision-makers.</p>

    <img src="/images/news-events/c66911d0a9eb905299582ea876c86e61.jpg">

    <h3>Bolivia: Impact of capacity development shaping policies in Bolivia</h3>

    <p>The utility of such projects has been highlighted on several occasions. For example, one of the general equilibrium models transferred by UNDESA was useful for informing the 2025 Patriotic Agenda by estimating GDP growth and government budget requirements to finance the implementation of plans and programs. The OSeMOSYS energy model enabled the Unit for Social and Economic Policy Analysis (UDAPE) of the Ministry of Development Planning to contribute analysis to support an assessment of energy sector development to help establish Bolivia's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) under the Paris agreement. Furthermore, the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning system of the country (LEAP) was updated by UNDESA, in collaboration with the Royal Institute of Technology of Sweden (KTH), and UNDP support. As a result of this, a conference was organized to disseminate the results of both energy models to a wide audience, addressing both contributions and limitations to key features of Bolivia’s Plan for Economic and Social Development 2016-2020 (PDES).  Selected policy notes using the energy models were used to inform the Energy Development Plan of the Ministry of Hydrocarbons.</p>

    <img src="/images/news-events/6356773ae86d853e714a2d97444c7f6b.jpg">

    <p>Likewise, in the Symposium "Promotion of inclusive and responsible public administration for sustainable development" that took place on March 16 and 17, 2016, Mrs. Mirna Mariscal, Subdirector of Macroeconomic Policy of UDAPE, highlighted the importance of capacity development projects to strengthen the technical expertise of the Government in the use and improvement of economic and energy models.</p>

    <p>The tools that are part of the UNDESA-UNDP portfolio include economy-wide models with modules in energy, health and human development; micro-simulations to assess the impact of policies on poverty dynamics and other household socio-economic indicators; energy systems models and energy planning. Currently, an integrated methodology of climate, land use, energy and water (CLEWs) is under development, which facilitates the analyses of interrelationships between the three dimensions of sustainable development -economic, environmental and social- in policy design and planning.</p>

    <p>Bolivia’s continuous engagement with the modelling tools and the evidence of their use to inform policies is a good example of the importance of making innovative and tailored models accessible to developing countries.</p>
